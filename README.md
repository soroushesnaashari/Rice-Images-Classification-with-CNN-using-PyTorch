### Overview
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify images of rice. The goal is to develop a robust model capable of distinguishing between different varieties of rice, which can be useful for quality control, research or agricultural applications. The project covers all the stepsâ€”from data preprocessing and model design to training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

### Project Workflow
The project follows an end-to-end workflow:

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
   - ***Dataset Collection:*** Images of rice are gathered from available datasets or captured from the field.
   - ***Preprocessing:*** The images are resized, normalized, and augmented (if needed) to improve the robustness of the model.
   - ***Splitting:*** The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Model Design & Implementation**
   - ***CNN Architecture:*** A custom CNN is built using PyTorch. The model includes several convolutional and pooling layers to extract features, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
   - ***Compilation:*** The model is defined with a loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD).

3. **Training & Evaluation**
   - ***Training:*** The network is trained over multiple epochs. Training includes real-time monitoring of loss and accuracy on the validation set.
   - ***Evaluation:*** The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices are used to assess performance.
   - ***Visualization:*** Training progress (loss and accuracy curves) and sample predictions are visualized to better understand the model's behavior.

4. **Results Analysis**
   - ***Performance Metrics:*** Final results include overall accuracy, per-class performance, and error analysis to identify potential misclassifications.
   - ***Discussion:*** Observations on model strengths, weaknesses, and areas for future improvement are discussed.
